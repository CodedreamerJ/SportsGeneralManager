  > Sports General Manager was developed for anyone who oversees sports leagues such as a general manager, team coach, team captain, team owners or someone who is interested in building a mock up sports league. Sports General Manager has a basic login system and a functional interface. The interface allows the person in charge to set up the entire league. These features provide the user the ability to create and implement a team into the league. In turn, they have the ability to add players to that team. The user also has the ability to provide restricted access to whoever is in charge of that team. They may choose to handle all the core necessities for their team such as naming their team and adding in players as well. The person in charge will also facilitate and provide access to the team owners by giving them the ability to create a username and password. This will allow the team leads to access the software so they can handle all their administrative duties. Within the software their is a database which handles all the data for one to access and utilize as they see fit.
